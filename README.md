# Live-Detection-using-Yolo-in-Raspberry-Pi

Real time detection using yolo models(Yolo v2, Yolo v2 tiny, Yolo v3, Yolo v3 tiny) with opencv.

Run "python yolo.py" file in terminal of Raspberry Pi.

I have tested it in Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and its giving good fps on cpu.

And don't forget to install opencv in raspberry pi and download .weights file from the official website of Yolo, https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
